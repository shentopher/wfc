## Introduction
Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a beautiful algorithm devised by Maxim Gumin (Twitter @ExUtumno) and employed by the likes of Oskar St√•lberg for procedural world and image generation. It draws inspiration from the quantum physics concept of the same name, which describes the 'collapse' of a wave function from a superposition of eigenstates into a single eigenstate. T

To learn more about WFC, I would highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY&ab_channel=MartinDonald) by Martin Donald. The [original repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) also contains a lot of general purpose information, as well as a well-articulated description of the algorithm.

The scope of this project is to port the algorithm into Python, as well as tinker with alternative heuristics. This work draws from the original repo, and it is deeply inspired by the work done by [Isaac Karth](https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_2019f) in terms of modularization of the codebase as well as best practices for method implementation.
