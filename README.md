# Wave Function Collapse: a Python Interpretation 
Author: Christopher Shen
Affiliation: University of Pennsylvania (Bachelor's)

Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a beautiful algorithm devised by Maximum Gumin and employed by the likes of Oskar St√•lberg for procedural world generation. It draws inspiration from a quantum physics concept of the same name, which describes the 'collapse' of a wave function from a superposition of eigenstates into a single eigenstate. To learn more about WFC, I would highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY&ab_channel=MartinDonald) by Martin Donald.

The scope of this project is to port the algorithm into Python, as well as tinker with alternative heuristics. This work draws from the original [repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), as well as work done by [Isaac Karth](https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_2019f) in porting the algorithm to Python in the past.
