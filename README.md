## Introduction
Wave Function Collapse (WFC) is a beautiful algorithm devised by Maxim Gumin (Twitter @ExUtumno) and employed by the likes of Oskar St√•lberg for procedural world and image generation. It draws inspiration from the quantum physics concept of the same name, which describes the 'collapse' of a wave function from a superposition of eigenstates into a single eigenstate. To learn more about WFC, I would highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY&ab_channel=MartinDonald) by Martin Donald.

The scope of this project is to port the algorithm into Python, as well as tinker with alternative heuristics. This work draws from the [original repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), as well references the work done by [Isaac Karth](https://github.com/ikarth/wfc_2019f) who performed a similar Python implementation.
